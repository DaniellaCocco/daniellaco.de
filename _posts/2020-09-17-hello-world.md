Obligatory very first "Hello world!" blog post. I'm planning on writing about software engineering, and intend on sharing snippets and helpful tips for problems I might've run into. Perhaps share some of my side projects, too.

Besides which, I figured writing plain language would be a nice change from writing code. And, of course, a little website like this is the perfect playground for using experimental techniques and libraries.

Let's see where this goes.
