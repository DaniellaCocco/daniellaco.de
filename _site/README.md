# daniellaco.de

Daniella Cocco's personal website.

## Development

You'll need [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

To develop locally, run:

```
jekyll serve
```

Visit [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to view the site. It'll rebuild as source files change.

## Production

To create a production-ready package, run:

```
jekyll build
```

This will output the static site to `_site`.

Any push to the master branch on GitHub will auto-deploy the latest generated site to [https://daniellaco.de](https://daniellaco.de) via GitHub Pages.
